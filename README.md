This is a project to show the distribution of the number of components in a graph off how many connections that graph has.
There's some online sources where you can find very comprehensive answers (https://mathoverflow.net/questions/172119/expected-number-of-connected-components-in-a-random-graph), but I wanted to show those distributions for different number of nodes, show the tables for those distributions, and make it easy for someone like me to read.
Linked in the project is the code I used the generate these results and some graphs to go along with them (data and graphs in attached spreadsheet).
Graphs are vertex-labeled and unweighted.
